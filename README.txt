USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK! IF YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR USING THIS, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE :v

SO DON'T GET CAUGHT!

How To Use:
Right click on LSCOFF.ps1
Click on Run With Powershell
You can now minimize the window.
To make sure lanschool is no longer running, you can check the icons on the bottom right corner of your screen.
If the lanschool icon disappears when you put your cursor over it, it worked.
